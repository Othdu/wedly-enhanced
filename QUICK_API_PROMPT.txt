I'm ready to integrate real APIs into my Wedly Flutter app. Currently using mock repositories that need to be replaced with actual API calls.

Current Setup:
- Clean architecture with BLoC pattern
- Mock repositories: AuthRepository and ServiceRepository in lib/data/repositories/
- Models: UserModel and ServiceModel in lib/data/models/
- Dependency injection with GetIt

What I need:
1. Replace mock methods in AuthRepository (login, logout, getCurrentUser) with real API calls
2. Replace mock methods in ServiceRepository (getServices, getServiceById, getServicesByCategory, getCategories) with real API calls
3. Add HTTP client (dio or http package)
4. Add JSON serialization to models
5. Implement secure token storage
6. Add error handling and network interceptors
7. Keep repository method signatures unchanged so BLoCs work without modifications

Please provide:
- Base API URL
- Authentication endpoints and token format
- Service endpoints (GET /services, GET /services/:id, etc.)
- Request/response JSON examples
- Error response format

[Paste your API documentation here when ready]
